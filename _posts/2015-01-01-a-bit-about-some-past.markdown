## MAREXdesign REEL 2008
At our university we did couple of exhibitions every year and this one was just before my job hunting so I decided to make my own demo reel. A lame reason but it got me motivated ;)

At that time I was kind of unsure what I wanted or was going to do in the future, so I made this DVD player thing float in the mid air to represent unstableness and by exposing raw materials to represent complexity of my mind/art/future. It could have been completely different but that's how I remember it now. It was cool that the DVD actually spun and played my demo reel.

This was my graduation project. I always loved or was interested in how things were made more then the actual completed thing. So that was my theme. Before starting with this project I did a lot of Motion Graphics with VFX, but somehow I was getting tiered of it. I kind of wanted to make something that looks like it's using VFX but when you finish watching it you kind of realize that there is no VFX.

This photo was taken while rehearsal. The truth is that this was an one shot video, but when watching it on the screen it kind of seems that those three people are in deferent places, but in reality they are just working on one big table at the same time, and that is the secret for not using VFX. We probably did like 8 or 9 takes to get it right. Here are some photos from the that day:

## Modeling

If you are a foreigner living in Tokyo there are a lot of opportunities for modeling and I was lucky to get some experience in TV-AD's, fashion magazines and some online stores. The biggest benefit I got out of it was when filming my own Motion Graphics it got easier to give acting instructions to actors, and some cash too ;)

Not so much but that's some of my past. I might add some more details on how or why I stopped doing all of that and now doing front-end development.
