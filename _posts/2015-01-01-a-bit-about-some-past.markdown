## MAREXdesign REEL 2008
Back when I was still in university I was using MAREXdesing as my brand name and making things or doing some freelancing work. Also, every year at our university we had to do couple of exhibitions, this one was just before my job hunting so I decided to make my own demo reel. A lame reason but it got me motivated ;)

At that time I was kind of unsure what I wanted or what I was going to to do in with my future, so I made this DVD player thing float in the mid air to represent unstableness and by exposing raw materials to represent complexity of my mind/art/future etc. It could have been completely different but that's how I remember it now. It was cool that the DVD actually spun and played my demo reel.

This was my graduation project. I always loved or was interested in how things were made more then the actual completed thing. So that was my theme. Before starting with this project I did a lot of Motion Graphics with VFX, but somehow I was getting tiered of it. I kind of wanted to make something that looks like it's using VFX but when you finish watching it you kind of realize that there is almost no VFX.

This photo was taken during the rehearsal. When watching the final version on different screens it would seem that the three people are in deferent places, doing their own thing in a different environment but in reality they are sitting at one big table and working at the same time, and that is the biggest secret for not using VFX or video editing to make it seem like the video was edited to be one video. We probably did like 8 or 9 takes to get it right. Here are some photos from the that day:

At out university we were fortunate enough to have a very nice studio that we could use almost anytime we wanted. As a student and without a budget it was always nice to have some friends helping each other with filming, acting + etc.

Workspace at the university was something like this. Yep, that's a [PowerBookG4](http://apple-history.com/compare/pg4_15167/mbp_15_mid_12), haha, time does fly by ;)

## Modeling
**![modeling](/assets/a-bit-about-the-past/modeling.jpg)**

If you are a foreigner living in Tokyo there are a lot of opportunities for modeling and I was lucky to get some experience in TV-AD's like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpWq3SaCzJg) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIxPNFkwO8A), fashion magazines, fashion related [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu1fvd6-u-U) and some on-line stores. [Here](/model/index.html) are some more photos. The biggest benefit I got out of it was when filming my own Motion Graphics it got easier to give acting instructions to actors, also some cash was nice too ;)

## Cycling

Cycling has been my biggest hobby since 2008. I don't race at the moment but the photos above are some from some races I did in Japan. I love hill climbing, that suffering feeling when you try to beat your best time on a hill makes me feel alive. My first road bike was [Felt](http://www.feltbicycles.com/) F75 2008, that white bike in the photos. Unfortunately that frame cracked while I was riding it. Now I ride a [BMC](http://www.bmc-switzerland.com/) SLR01 2011. I did some epic rides like [this](https://www.strava.com/activities/595861) 209km ride, [this](https://www.strava.com/activities/1581861) ride with 7,358m climbing, [this](https://www.strava.com/activities/6777065) 7.5h ride in the rain and [this](https://www.strava.com/activities/190857535) Mt.Fuji ride with some friends.

Not so much but that's some of my past. I might add some more details on how or why I stopped doing MotionGraphics and became a front-end developer.
